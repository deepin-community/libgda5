Libgda DDL example
==================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to use the GdaServerOperation object to execute
DDL queries (queries which do not manipulate data, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE).

It simply creates a ddl_db.db SQLite database file in which a table is added.

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./ddl

The resulting ddl_db.db SQLite file should contain a single table named "products":

[prompt]> sqlite3 ddl_db.db
SQLite version 3.4.0
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE products (id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, product_name string NOT NULL);
